### What I learned

This particular challenge was a rewarding one: I had to use lists and tables, which pushed me to explore and apply new, sophisticated methods for styling these core HTML elements.

```css
.ingredients-list li, .instructions-list li {
  list-style-position: outside;
}
```
```css
.ingredients-list li::marker, .instructions-list li::marker {
  color: var(--rose-800);
}
```
```css
.calories-table {
  table-layout: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
```
